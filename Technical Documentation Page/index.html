                <p>CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a powerful language used to style the presentation of HTML documents. While HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, CSS allows you to control how that content is displayed on the screen. With CSS, you can define styles for various elements of your HTML document, such as fonts, colors, spacing, layour, and more. By separating the content from its presentation, CSS promotes cleaner code, easier maintenance, and greater flexibility in design.</p>
                <p>Types of Cascading Style Sheets</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inline CSS is applied directly to HTML elements using the "style" attribute.</li>
                    <li>Internal CSS is placed within the "style" element in the "head" section of an HTML document.</li>
                    <li>External CSS is stored in separate CSS files and linked to HTML documents using the "link" element.</li>
